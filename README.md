## Design Requirement

**Due Date : Feb 28, 2020 at 11:59 PM**
The objective of this assignment is to instill in you the techniques for turning an object model into a
machine for information gathering and data aggregation. We want to use software engineering
techniques to improve the quality of education anywhere and hold people accountable for improving
the quality of life through education, learning to learn, and feedback.
Your task to study ways to create a performance measurement solution to enable universities to
measure the quality of the education they deliver to their students. The approach will be to look into
how an educational system in terms of faculty and courses contribute to the growth of their graduates
over a 5-year period. You must figure out ways to track the jobs and promotions graduates get over time
and assign rankings accordingly. In addition, track the connection of courses and their relevance to
graduates growth. Also, study the relationship between GPAs and industrial success (In other words, do
grades matter?) Also, discuss how to apply your digital ideas and solutions to k-to-12 educational
systems in the developing countries.
One of your deliverables will be to design a dashboard that enables college and university
administrators to compare the performance of their academic units.
One important question, is to define your own ranking system of educational institutions especially for
the developing world.
Deliverables
1. Report outlining your proposed solution.
2. Sequence diagrams showing how to navigate the university object model to deliver performance
metrics needed for performance and feedback.
3. An object model showing the changes to the university model to support the new capabilities. This
must include the additional methods and attributes required to deliver the results.
Your application must enable the creation and update functions for any of the attributes of concern. It
will be okay to assume each of these questions are buttons on the left/right side of the screen
depending on your design.
Note
There is no need for java implementations, just a report with the specifications of how to implement
such a solution.
